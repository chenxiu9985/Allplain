Xunlei Web Thunder is prone to a remote buffer-overflow vulnerability because the application fails to perform adequate boundary-checks on user-supplied data.

An attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into visiting a maliciously crafted webpage.

Successfully exploiting this issue will allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the application using the ActiveX control (typically Microsoft Internet Explorer). Failed exploit attempts will result in a denial-of-service condition.

This issue affects Xunlei Web Thunder 5.6.8.344; other versions may also be affected.
