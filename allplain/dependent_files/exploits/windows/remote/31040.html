Surveillix DVR 'MeIpCamX.DLL' ActiveX control is prone to multiple buffer-overflow vulnerabilities because the application fails to perform adequate boundary checks on user-supplied data.

Successfully exploiting these issues allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application using the ActiveX control (typically Internet Explorer). Failed exploit attempts likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

These issues affect 'MeIpCamX.DLL' 1.0.0.4; other versions may also be vulnerable.
