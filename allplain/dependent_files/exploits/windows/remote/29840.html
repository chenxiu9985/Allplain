Roxio CinePlayer is prone to a stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently check boundaries of user-supplied input before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory buffer.

A remote attacker may exploit this issue by enticing victims into opening a malicious HTML document.

Exploiting this issue allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of applications using the affected ActiveX control and to compromise affected computers. Failed attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

Roxio CinePlayer 3.2 is vulnerable; other versions may also be affected.
